## Information about program
```
The Calculator app has the functions of a regular basic calculator. You are able to add, subtract, mulitply, divide, 
and use modulo operation. When you click on a button it turns red, and when you click on a different button, the 
previous button returns to it's original color.

I created this project to learn more about Vue.js components by making a simple app.
